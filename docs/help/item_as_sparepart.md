### Item as spare part

When an item is marked as  ‘Spare part’, when issuing that item to an asset, it will be added as a sparepart of the asset.

The Quantity is used to indicate the number of the spare part items normally found on the asset. The Issued Quantity records the number of the item issued to the asset over time. This can be limited to a certain quantity by setting the ‘Maximum Quantity Issued’ field on the Item Master record. For example, a brand of software issued to a PC should not exceed a quantity of one. There is also a Remarks field with long description on the Spare Parts table.
